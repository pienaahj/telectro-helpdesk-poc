# Production Deployment Runbook

## Purpose

This runbook captures the requirements, deployment model, backup/rollback expectations, and operational checks required before the ERPNext Pilot can be deployed to a production-facing server.

The first production deployment should be treated as a controlled technical deployment, not an instant go-live.

## Production Readiness Questions

The questions below are intended to be answerable by non-DevOps stakeholders.

Where possible, the questions avoid technical implementation terms and focus on operational ownership:

- who owns the server
- who owns the domain
- who owns the certificate
- who owns email
- who signs off testing
- who approves go-live

The answers to these questions must be confirmed before production deployment starts.

## 1. Access address

What address should users type into their browser to access the system?

Examples:

- <https://support.telectro.co.za>
- <https://erp.telectro.co.za>
- <https://helpdesk.telectro.co.za>

Required answer:

- Preferred web address
- Whether Telectro controls this domain
- Who can update the domain settings

Why this matters:

The web address is the name users will bookmark and use daily.

The HTTPS certificate must match this address, and the domain must point to the production server before public HTTPS access can work correctly.

## 2. Server

Where will the production system run?

Required answer:

- Server provider or hosting location
- Ubuntu version if known
- Public IP address
- SSH access method
- Who has admin access
- Whether Docker is allowed
- Whether outbound internet access is allowed

## 3. Firewall / public access

Who controls which ports are open to the internet?

Required answer:

- Who manages firewall rules
- Whether ports 80 and 443 can be opened
- Whether SSH should be limited to specific IP addresses

Why this matters:

A production system exposed to the internet should only expose the minimum required ports.

Expected public access:

```text
80   HTTP, mainly for certificate setup/renewal and redirecting users to HTTPS
443  HTTPS, normal browser access
```

Administrative access:

```text
22   SSH, preferably restricted to trusted IP addresses where possible
```

Other application/database ports should not normally be exposed directly to the internet.

## 4. Certificate

Telectro has confirmed that the certificate is available.

Required answer:

- What domain name is the certificate for?
- Is it a wildcard certificate, for example \*.telectro.co.za?
- What files are available?
- Who renews the certificate?
- When does it expire?

Why this matters:

The certificate enables HTTPS.

A certificate usually consists of a public certificate file, a private key file, and sometimes a chain/intermediate certificate file.

The private key is sensitive and must not be committed to Git, pasted into documentation, or shared casually.

The certificate also needs a renewal plan. An expired certificate will cause browser warnings and may block users from accessing the system.

## 5. Email

Which real email address should the system use for outgoing mail and testing?

Required answer:

- SMTP server address
- SMTP port
- username
- whether password/app-password is available
- sender email address
- whether the account can receive replies
- whether inbound ticket creation from email is required now or later

For pilot production, we may choose:

```text
Phase 1: outgoing email only
Phase 2: incoming helpdesk mailbox after production is stable
```

Why this matters:

There are two separate email concerns:

```text
Outgoing email:
The system sends messages to users.

Incoming email:
The system reads a mailbox and creates tickets from received emails.
```

For first production deployment, outgoing email is the safer first milestone.

Incoming helpdesk mailbox processing can be enabled later after the production site, HTTPS, backups, and basic user access are stable.

## 6. Real users

Which users should exist at first production setup?

Required answer:

- Telectro admin/contact
- technicians
- coordinator/supervisor users
- partner users
- Boschendal contacts
- which users should receive email notifications
- which users should only be login users

Use a spreadsheet to confirm the first production user list before creating accounts.

Suggested columns:

```text
Name
Email address
Organisation / customer / partner
User type
Required role/profile
Should receive email notifications
Should be able to log in
Notes
```

Important distinction:

```text
User account:
A person who can log in to Frappe/ERPNext.
```

Email account:
A mailbox the system connects to for sending or receiving email.

A user can be created before full email testing is complete, but password reset, welcome emails, and notifications depend on outgoing email being configured correctly.

## What can be tested locally

The following can continue to be tested in the local Docker environment using test users and the local mail server:

- roles
- role profiles
- workspaces
- reports
- Partner route guard
- Partner-safe ticket pages
- ticket workflow
- evidence upload
- assignment and routing logic
- Notification Log row creation
- manual ticket creation
- Partner acceptance and Partner work review flows

Local testing proves the application logic.

It does not prove public HTTPS, real DNS, real SMTP delivery, or real mailbox intake.

## What needs real or staging infrastructure

The following require a real production-like environment:

- DNS pointing the chosen web address to the server
- public firewall access
- HTTPS certificate installation
- real browser access over HTTPS
- outgoing SMTP authentication
- real email delivery
- incoming mailbox processing, if required
- production backup location
- restore testing from production-style backup
- production user login testing

These should be tested before operational go-live.

## Recommended rollout phases

### Phase 1: Production requirements confirmed

Confirm:

- web address
- server access
- firewall ownership
- certificate details
- email account details
- initial user/contact list
- backup location
- go-live owner
- testing/sign-off owner

### Phase 2: Technical deployment

Deploy the system to the production server using a controlled manual process.

This phase proves:

- Docker Compose deployment
- site availability
- database migration
- application startup
- administrator login

This is not yet operational go-live.

### Phase 3: HTTPS proof

Prove:

- domain resolves to the server
- HTTPS works
- certificate matches the chosen domain
- browser access is clean
- HTTP redirects to HTTPS if required

### Phase 4: Email proof

Prove outgoing email first.

Check:

- system can authenticate to SMTP
- test email is delivered to a real inbox
- sender address is acceptable
- messages are not blocked or rejected

Incoming helpdesk mailbox processing should only be enabled after outgoing email is stable.

### Phase 5: User smoke testing

Create or activate a small first batch of users.

Minimum smoke checks:

- administrator login
- technician login
- coordinator/supervisor login
- Partner login
- workspace landing
- ticket creation
- Partner-safe ticket access
- evidence upload/download
- notification visibility

### Phase 6: Controlled go-live

Only after technical deployment, HTTPS, email, backups, and smoke checks are proven should the site be considered ready for operational use.

## Not in scope for the first production deployment

The first production deployment should not try to solve everything at once.

The following can come later:

- fully automated GitHub deployment pipeline
- incoming helpdesk mailbox automation
- advanced notification tuning
- browser/mobile push notifications
- multi-server clustering
- Docker Swarm
- high-availability setup
- automated user imports
- advanced monitoring dashboards

The first goal is a controlled, recoverable, single-server deployment with known backup, rollback, HTTPS, email, and smoke-test procedures.
